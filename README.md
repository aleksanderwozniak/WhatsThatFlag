## Info

> Countries are no longer fetched from the Internet. In order to support translations, I've decided to move them to .xml file. If for some reason you still want to populate the list via Internet, then check ***countries-from-net*** branch.

Game currently supports these languages:
* English *[default]*
* Polish

*More translations will be added in the future*
